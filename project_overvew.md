# Learning Path Recommender Agent

## Project Overview

The **Learning Path Recommender Agent** is an AI-powered multi-agent system designed to generate highly personalized learning roadmaps from large course catalogs.
It analyzes a learner’s existing skills, goals, learning style, time availability, and past progress to create adaptive, efficient learning paths.

Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on static filtering, this project uses **LLM-powered AI agents, semantic search (RAG), and collaborative reasoning** to dynamically plan and adjust learning journeys.

## What This Project Builds

This project delivers a complete intelligent learning assistant that includes:

* Personalized learning roadmap generator
* Course semantic understanding using embeddings
* Adaptive planning based on learner progress
* Interactive chat assistant for guidance
* Weekly structured study schedules
* Visual dashboards with progress tracking

## Key Components Included

* Learner skill analysis & profiling
* Course catalog ingestion & semantic indexing
* AI-driven learning path planner
* Continuous progress tracking & replanning
* Chat-based interactive guidance system

## Why This Project Is Unique

* Uses real AI agents instead of rule-based filtering
* Semantic course understanding via embeddings + RAG
* Dynamic personalization based on learning style & pace
* Feedback loop that updates recommendations continuously
* Interactive conversational interface for adjustments
* Scalable architecture that can integrate real learning platforms

## Expected Impact

This system helps learners:

* Avoid information overload
* Follow structured learning efficiently
* Identify skill gaps clearly
* Maintain motivation through visible progress
* Adapt learning plans as goals evolve
