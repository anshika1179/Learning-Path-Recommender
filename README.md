# Learning Path Recommender Agent 
An intelligent **multi-agent AI system** that creates highly personalized, adaptive learning roadmaps by analyzing your skills, goals, time availability, learning style, and progress.

Unlike basic recommenders, this project uses **LLM-powered agents**, **semantic search (RAG)**, and **collaborative reasoning** to build dynamic learning paths that evolve as you learn.
This isn't just a recommender — it's an intelligent learning companion.

##  Why This Project Is Unique
Compared to basic course recommenders:
- **Real AI Agents** with collaborative reasoning (not just pandas rules)
- **Semantic Search** via embeddings & RAG for deep content understanding
- **Adaptive Learning Paths** that evolve with progress and feedback
- **Difficulty Progression** to prevent overwhelm
- **Conversational Guidance** for real-time adjustments
- **Rich Visual Feedback** (timelines, heatmaps, weekly plans)


##  Key Features
- **Personalized Roadmap Generation** – Tailored to your current skills, goals, and weekly hours
- **Semantic Course Understanding** – Embeddings + RAG for deep content matching
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning** – Dedicated agents for profiling, analysis, planning, and validation
- **Difficulty-Aware Recommendations** – Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced progression
- **Interactive Chat Assistant** – Ask for adjustments, explanations, quizzes, or easier alternatives
- **Weekly Actionable Plans** – Breaks roadmap into daily/weekly tasks
- **Progress Tracking & Adaptive Replanning** – Updates path based on completions and feedback
- **Visual Dashboard** – Timeline view, progress heatmap, skill gaps, and more
- **Explainable Recommendations** – Clear "why this course" reasoning with alternatives
